# Hello, I'm Nikola

## About me!

Hello I'm Nikola, a full stack software developer in Auckland. I recently graduated high school in mid 2025 and went right into Dev Academy in August of 2025 to learn and pursue a career in software development.

I have been interested in coding most of my life, from having some experience at home and at school, and being around coders my whole life like my family and friends. From the last few months I’ve learnt to really enjoy coding and working with people to solve problems and create unique solutions.

I’m now graduating from Dev Academy after learning full stack development as well as learning and developing strong communication, leadership and teamwork abilities. 

Now I’m practicing all the skills I learnt as well as discovering and working with many more frameworks and databases like Svelte and PostgresSQL. I'm also working on a few projects, like Glighfe and I am planning an app which is a personalised game library with a list of many games and links to stores as well as ways to add them to collections…
